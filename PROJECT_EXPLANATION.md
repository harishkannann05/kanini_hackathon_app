## 2. The Solution: How Medicy Works (1 Minute)
"Medicy isn't just a booking app; it's a **decision support system**.
It automates the triage process using AI to instantly analyze symptoms and vital signs.
*   **Step 1:** Detailed patient data (symptoms, age, vitals) is collected.
*   **Step 2:** Our AI Engine calculates a **Risk Score** and assigns a priority level (High, Medium, Low) in real-time.
*   **Step 3:** The system intelligently routes the patient to the right department and doctor, managing the entire queue dynamically."

## 3. Key Modules & Demo Walkthrough (2 Minutes)
"Let me walk you through the three core pillars of our platform:"

### A. Triage Officer Dashboard (The "Control Tower")
"First, the Triage Dashboard. This is where clarity meets chaos.
*   Officers see a **Live Queue** sorted by *medical urgency*, not just arrival time.
*   **Smart Indicators** highlight critical patients instantly.
*   We use **Real-time WebSockets**, so as soon as a patient is registered, they appear here instantly—no page refreshes needed."

### B. Doctor's Cockpit (The "Action Center")
"Next, the Doctor's Interface, which we've designed for focus and speed.
*   **Active Patient Card:** A premium, distraction-free view of the current patient.
*   **AI Medical Insights:** The systems flags potential conditions based on symptoms, acting as a second pair of eyes.
*   **Seamless Workflow:** Doctors can start visits, view risk levels, and complete consultations with single-tap actions."

### C. Admin Analytics (The "Big Picture")
"Finally, the Admin Dashboard for hospital management.
*   We visualize **Department Load** (Cardiology vs. General) and **Risk Distribution** using interactive charts.
*   This helps administrators allocate resources effectively—if Cardiology is getting overwhelmed, they know immediately."
