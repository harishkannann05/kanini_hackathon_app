AI-Powered Smart Patient Triage Hackathon 
Technology-Driven Innovation in Healthcare using AI & Data 
 
 
Overview 
Healthcare systems worldwide face increasing patient loads, limited medical resources, and 
inefficiencies in early risk identification. Traditional triage processes rely heavily on manual 
evaluation, leading to delays in identifying high-risk patients, overcrowded departments, 
inconsistent prioritization, and increased operational strain. 
Problem Statement 
Design and develop an AI-based system that analyzes patient symptoms and basic medical 
history to: 
- Classify patients into risk levels (Low / Medium / High) 
- Recommend the appropriate medical department 
- Provide explainable insights behind predictions 
- Support efficient patient prioritization and reduced wait times 
Scope of the Solution 
The system should include: 
• 
Patient Input Module (Age, Gender, Symptoms, Vitals, Pre-existing conditions) 
• 
Tool should able to load health document as input (EHR or EMR doc) 
• 
AI Risk Classification Engine (ML, Rule-based, or Hybrid) 
• 
Department Recommendation Engine (e.g., General Medicine, Cardiology, Emergency, 
Neurology) 
• 
Explainability Layer (Contributing factors, confidence score) 
• 
Dashboard Interface (Risk summary, visualizations, department insights) 
Data Guidelines 
Participants will be provided with a standardized patient metadata schema. Teams must 
generate synthetic data using a Synthetic Data Vault–like tool or equivalent framework.
